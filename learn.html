    <!-- ABOUT ECOSYSTEM OF CARDS -->
    <h2 id="ECOSYSTEM">THE ECOSYSTEM OF CARD GAMES</h2>

    <p>Keyforge was and is methodone for former Magic the Gathering players. A game by Richard Garfield with a fresh
      take on the card game experience.</p>
    <p class="quote">Less Deck Building, More Gaming.</p>
    <p>Because of this it is impossible to talk about KEYFORGE without talking about games that exist(ed) before and
      after it.</p>

    <p>At its launch the ways that Keyforge set out to fix the TCG/LCG/Card Battling experience were
      exciting.</p>
    <p>
    <p>OUT were detractors like:</p>
    ❌ Frequent Erattas / Card Bannings.
    <br>
    ❌ Pay-to-Win Incentives. *Cough* MTG *Cough*
    <br>
    ❌ Land Flooding.
    <br>
    ❌ Net Decking creating a stale or redundant meta.
    <br>
    ❌ Rotation.
    <br>
    ❌ Land..in general.
    <p>IN were new concepts like:</p>
    ✅ No Resource Management!
    <br>
    ✅ No Counter Spells or out-Of-Turn play!
    <br>
    ✅ No Milling to death!
    <br>
    </p>
    <p>Since keyforge does not exist on an island..
      <br>
    <div><img src="img/mtg/mtg-volcano-island.jpg" class="imgcardfull"></div>

    ...AND I want to post as many cool and vintage magic the gathering and pokemon card images on my site as I want. you
    will see many references to other card games on this site e.g. this pikachu about to be crushed in the art for Fang
    House from Set 2 (Age of Ascension).</p>

    <img src="img/blog-graphics/content_blog_graphic_023-400-800.jpg" class="imgbordered">


    <p>Keyforge payed fan service in this way. It created BOTH a unique mythology AND payed homage to games past.</p>

    <p>A great example is the card Frigorific Rod from set 5 aka from Dark Tidings. It makes reference to the MTG card
      icy
      manipulator right in the flavor text. </p>

    <p class="quote">"Is it cold in here, or is it just you?” — Sibyl Waimare</p>

    <p>Another example is Foggify, Fogbank and the quintessential commander staple FOG.</p>

    <!-- FORMAT EXAMPLES -->
    <div id="formatexamples">

      <h1 id="FORMATS">FORMATS</h1>

      <h2 id="ARCHONFORMAT"> &#128293; ARCHON</h2>
      <p>There is no CONSTRUCTED in keyforge but this is the closest thing.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Official Format</li>
        <li>Each player brings a deck to use at the event</li>
        <li>You get to see your opponents deck list pre-game</li>
        <li>Best-Of-One (generally)</li>
        <li>35 min rounds</li>
        <li>Chainbound (generally)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Even quality keyforge decks can be really challenging to pilot so this has been the most enjoyable format for
        me because it allows the most practice ahead of tournament.</p>

      <img src="img/archon-1.jpg" class="imageadaptiveinfographic">

      <br>
      <p>In general "spike" or competitive players are drawn to this format. Similar to "standard" in Magic the
        Gathering.
      <p>
      <p>Because of the lack of deckbuilding and the scarcity/opinionated-ness around what makes a strong deck or
        player...some spike players may actually gravitate towards more intense formats like reversal or adapative!</p>
      <hr>
      <!-- ADAPTIVE -->
      <h2 id="ADAPTIVEFORMAT">&#x1F9E0; ADAPTIVE</h2>

      <p>Best of 3 format iteration with chain bidding based on outcomes.</p>

      <p>Each player brings an archon or sealed deck and plays normally in a best of 3. </p>
      <img src="img/adaptive-1.jpg" class="imageadaptiveinfographic">

      <p>For the second game, each player swaps decks with his or her opponent and plays using his or her opponent’s
        deck.
      </p>

      <img src="img/adaptive-2.png" class="imageadaptiveinfographic">

      <p>If the third game occurs, players bid chains to use the deck which won both of the previous games.</p>
      <img src="img/adaptive-3.png" class="imageadaptiveinfographic">

      <p>Other formats include TRIAD, Competitive Reversal, Adaptive-Short (Adaptive with only 1 round).</p>

      <!-- REVERSAL -->
      <h2 id="REVERSAL">&#128579; REVERSAL</h2>
      <p>Bring your worst deck and your opponent must play it against you.</p>
      <p> Here are some cards related to the REVERSAL format!</p>

      <p>Control the Game. Disrupt the tempo.</p>

      <p>Dis, Unfathomable, Mars are 3 of the most control-centric houses.</p>

      <img src="img/blog-graphics/content_blog_graphic_001.jpg" class="imgbordered">

      <p> Here are some quintessential CONTROL cards:</p>

      <!-- COMBO -->
      <h2 id="COMBOS">COMBOS</h2>
      <p>Put the cards together and win! These decks focus on 2-3 card combos or clear synergies for a win condition.
      </p>
      <p>Example: Here is a jankier combo that this currently valid in Magic the Gathering's STANDARD format (at the
        time
        of writing this 2022). The idea is that you play out the Demon KICKED and then activate level 3 of the Warlock
        class on the same turn resulting in a Win.</p>

      <img src="img/mtg/491760.jpg" class="imgcardfull">
      <img src="img/mtg/527412.jpg" class="imgcardfull">

      <p>It requires 14 mana but to execute. It is an instant win if the player can somehow pull it off, these combos
        are
        frequently referred to as One Turn Kill (OTK) combos. </p>

      <hr>

      <p>Here is another (less costed) combo that this currently valid in Magic the Gathering's STANDARD format (2022).
      </p>

      <p>Since faceless haven can be all creature types..the combo here is to put the artifact's loyalty counter on the
        faceless haven and never turn it into a creature.</p>



      <img src="img/mtg/527291.jpg" class="imgcardfull">
      <img src="img/mtg/503874.jpg" class="imgcardfull">

      <p>This creates a scenario where your opponent cannot win and you cannot lose if they do not have land
        destruction.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <p> Here are some quintessential 🧩 COMBO cards:</p>

      <!-- RUSH -->
      <h2 id="RUSH">RUSH</h2>
      <p>Sonic the hedgehog. Superman. A Speeding Bullet. Ferrari. These decks floor it and don't look back. This an
        interesting strategy for a number of reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make all other strategies irrelevant by simply being faster.</li>
        <li>Requires Less Cognitive lift at a tournament (compared to a more board or trick heavy deck.</li>
        <li>Wins Faster. More Time to recover between matches/games.</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="img/blog-graphics/content_blog_graphic_011.jpg" class="imgbordered">

      <p> Here are some example RUSH cards:</p>

      <img src="img/card_images/341_222_QR5CWH4G69H3_en.png" class="imgcardfull">

      <p>RUSH or speed decks are a good style of play for a new player:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Easier to find/purchase.</li>
        <li>Can frequently brute force victories and forge keys via cheat so the opponent cannot respond with Amber
          Control</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- MID-RANGE -->
      <h2 id="MIDRANGE">MID-RANGE</h2>
      <p>A solid performer. It may not be top tier but is still competitive enough for archon solo or best of three.</p>

      <p>The majority of Keyforge decks are in this middling area.</p>

      <p>A skilled player could go 4/4 with this type of deck in a sealed or casual environment</p>

      <img src="img/blog-graphics/content_blog_graphic_005.jpg" class="imgbordered">

      <p>A good example midrange deck would be a Brobnar / Shadows / Untamed deck from set 1 aka Call of the Archons
        (CotA) with an equal focus on Fighting, Stealing, and Rushing.</p>

      <hr>

      <!-- GROUP HUG -->
      <h2 id="GROUPHUG">GROUP HUG</h2>
      <p>The primary goal of a group hug deck is to make sure everyone gets to have fun and do cool things with their
        deck. Usually with a focus on symmetrical benefits that lead into a sneaky win condition.</p>

      <img src="img/blog-graphics/content_blog_graphic_014.jpg" class="imgbordered">

      <h2 id="STEAL">STEAL</h2>

      <p>Just....strait up...STEAL. Thievery. Crime. Shadows.</p>


      <p>The footprint of this affect that plays to the win condition is still felt although the strength of shadows and
        stealing has diminished a bit since the Call of the Archons set.</p>

      <p>Throughout the history of Card Game Development (starting with magic the gathering) there's been insider
        references and world-building subtext hidden in art, themes, and flavor text of cards. </p>

      <p>Here is an example from standard mtg right now (2021). Eaten alive shows how the champion of the parish met his
