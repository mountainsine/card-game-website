            <h2>KEYFORGE REFRESHER</h2>
            <p>❌ This is not a NEW PLAYER STARTING GUIDE (this has been done successfully and better elsewhere).</p>
            <p>✅ Instead this will be a refresher of core concepts, formats, and keyforge ideas that may run adjacent to learning about keyforge.</p>

            <!-- FORMAT EXAMPLES -->
            <div id="formatexamples">
                <h2>Formats</h2>
                &#128293; ARCHON
                <p>Similar to "standard" in magic the gathering"</p>
                <p>In general "spike" or competitive players are drawn to this format.<p
                <br>  
                <p>Keyforge is weird though...because of the lack of deckbuilding and the scarcity/opinionated-ness around what makes a strong deck or player...some spike players may actually gravitate towards more intense formats like reversal or adapative!</p>
                <hr>
                <!-- ADAPTIVE -->
                &#x1F9E0; ADAPTIVE
                <p>A more skill intensive iteration with chain bidding based on outcomes.</p>
                <hr>

                <!-- REVERSAL -->
                 &#128579; REVERSAL
                <p>Bring your worst deck and your opponent must play it against you.</p>
                <hr>
            </div>
            There are many other formats as well including some fan created ones like Adaptive-Short (Adaptive with only 1 round)

                <h2>Archetypes</h2>

                Gameplay motifs, strategies, and categorizations. 

                As with many things KEYFORGE...frequently decks will become a blend of these ideas and card focus points.

                <!-- COMBO -->
                <p>&#129513; Combo</p>
                <p>Put the cards together and play to the lines.</p>
                <hr>

                <!-- CONTROL -->
                <p>&#128721; Control</p>
                <p>Control the Game. Disrupt the tempo.</p>

                <p>Dis, Unfathomable, Mars are 3 of the most control-centric houses.</p>

                <!-- RUSH -->
                <p>&#128640; Rush</p>
                <p>Make all other strategies irrelevant by simply being faster!</p>

                <!-- MIDRANGE -->
                <p>MIDRANGE</p>
                <p>A solid performer that may is not toptier but also not "not-competitive"</p>
