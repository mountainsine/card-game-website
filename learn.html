            <h2>KEYFORGE REFRESHER</h2>
            <p>❌ This is not a NEW PLAYER STARTING GUIDE (this has been done successfully and better elsewhere).</p>
            <p>✅ Instead this will be a refresher of core concepts, formats, and keyforge ideas that may run adjacent to learning about keyforge.</p>

            <p>With gameplay motifs, strategies, and categorizations.....as with many things KEYFORGE...frequently decks will become a blend of these ideas and card focus points. </p>

                <h2> &#128293; ARCHON FORMAT</h2>
                <p>Similar to "standard" in magic the gathering"</p>
                <p>In general "spike" or competitive players are drawn to this format.<p
                <br>  
                <p>Keyforge is weird though...because of the lack of deckbuilding and the scarcity/opinionated-ness around what makes a strong deck or player...some spike players may actually gravitate towards more intense formats like reversal or adapative!</p>

                <!-- ADAPTIVE -->
                <h2>&#x1F9E0; ADAPTIVE FORMAT</h2>
