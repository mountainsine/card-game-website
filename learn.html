            <h2>KEYFORGE REFRESHER</h2>
            <p>❌ This is not a NEW PLAYER STARTING GUIDE (this has been done successfully and better elsewhere).</p>
            <p>✅ Instead this will be a refresher of core concepts, formats, and keyforge ideas that may run adjacent to learning about keyforge.</p>

            <p>With gameplay motifs, strategies, and categorizations.....as with many things KEYFORGE...frequently decks will become a blend of these ideas and card focus points. </p>

                <p>In general "spike" or competitive players are drawn to this format. Similar to "standard" in magic the gathering" except there is no rotation or bannings<p 
                <p>Because of the lack of deckbuilding and the scarcity/opinionated-ness around what makes a strong deck or player...some spike players may actually gravitate towards more intense formats like reversal or adapative!</p>

                <p>A more skill intensive iteration with chain bidding based on outcomes.</p>

                <p>Each player brings an archon or sealed deck and plays normally in a best of 3. </p>

                <p>For the second game, each player swaps decks with his or her opponent and plays using his or her opponent’s deck. </p>

                <p>Other formats include TRIAD, Competitive Reversal, Adaptive-Short (Adaptive with only 1 round).</p>
