            <h2>KEYFORGE REFRESHER</h2>
            <p>❌ This is not a NEW PLAYER STARTING GUIDE (this has been done successfully and better elsewhere).</p>
            <p>✅ Instead this will be a refresher of core concepts, formats, and keyforge ideas that may run adjacent to learning about keyforge.</p>

            <p>With gameplay motifs, strategies, and categorizations.....as with many things KEYFORGE...frequently decks will become a blend of these ideas and card focus points. </p>

                <br> 
                <p>In general "spike" or competitive players are drawn to this format. Similar to "standard" in magic the gathering" except there is no rotation or bannings<p 
                <p>Because of the lack of deckbuilding and the scarcity/opinionated-ness around what makes a strong deck or player...some spike players may actually gravitate towards more intense formats like reversal or adapative!</p>

                <!-- ADAPTIVE -->
                <h2>&#x1F9E0; ADAPTIVE FORMAT</h2>
                
                <p>A more skill intensive iteration with chain bidding based on outcomes.</p>

                <p>Each player brings an archon or sealed deck and plays normally in a best of 3. </p>
                <img src="img/adaptive-1.jpg" class="imageadaptiveinfographic">

                <p>For the second game, each player swaps decks with his or her opponent and plays using his or her opponent’s deck. </p>

                <p>Other formats include TRIAD, Competitive Reversal, Adaptive-Short (Adaptive with only 1 round).</p>

                <p>Put the cards together and win! These decks focus on 2-3 card combos or clear synergies for a win condition.</p>
                <p>Example: Here is a jankier combo that this currently valid in Magic the Gathering's STANDARD format (at the time of writing this 2022). The idea is that you play out the Demon KICKED and then activate level 3 of the Warlock class on the same turn resulting in a Win.</p>

                <p>It requires 14 mana but to execute. It is an instant win if the player can somehow pull it off, these combos are frequently referred to as One Turn Kill (OTK) combos. </p>

                <p>Here is another (less costed) combo that this currently valid in Magic the Gathering's STANDARD format (2022).</p>

                <p>Since faceless haven can be all creature types..the combo here is to put the artifact's loyalty counter on the faceless haven and never turn it into a creature.</p>
