    <p>The way Keyforge set out to fix the TCG experience was bold.</p>
    <p>
    <p>Problems:</p>
    ❌ Frequent Erattas / Card Bannings.
    <br>
    ❌ Pay-to-Win Incentives. *Cough* MTG *Cough*
    <br>
    ❌ Land Flooding.
    <br>
    ❌ Net Decking (Creating a stale meta).
    <br>
    ❌ Rotation.
    <br>
    ❌ Land..in general.
    <p>Strong selling points included:</p>
    ✅ No Resource Management!
    <br>
    ✅ No Counter Spells or Out-Of-Turn play!
    <br>
    ✅ No Milling to death!
    <br>
    ✅ Every Deck Uniquely Generated.
    <br>
    </p>
    <p>In the realm of games (specifically TCGs that are not MTG) Keyforge did not exist on an island:

    <img src="img/blog-graphics/content_blog_graphic_031.png" class="imgbordered">

    <p>Keyforge payed fan service in this way. It created BOTH a unique mythology (see <a href="#CARDSTORYTELLING">Card
        Story-Telling</a>) AND payed homage to games past.</p>

    <p>A great example is the mtg card Concordant Crossroads and the kf card Speed Sigil which basically share the same function </p>

    <p>Another example is the card Frigorific Rod from set 5 aka from Dark Tidings. It makes reference to the MTG card
      icy manipulator right in the flavor text. </p>

    <p>Here is another example with Tautau Vapors and the iconic Yu-Gi-Oh! card Pot of Greed. A card that while on the
      ban list has remained a fan favorite thanks to its game-breaking quality and now meme status.</p>

    <!-- FORMAT EXAMPLES -->
    <div id="formatexamples">

      <h1 id="FORMATS">FORMATS</h1>

      <h2 id="ARCHONFORMAT"> &#128293; ARCHON</h2>
      <p>There is no constructed in keyforge but this is the closest thing. Think friday night magic "standard" in Magic
        the Gathering. In general "spike" or competitive players
        are drawn to this format.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Official Format</li>
        <li>Each player brings a deck to use at the event</li>
        <li>You get to see your opponents deck list pre-game</li>
        <li>Best-Of-One (generally)</li>
        <li>35 min rounds</li>
        <li>Chainbound (generally)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Keyforge decks can be really challenging to pilot so this has been the most enjoyable format for
        me because it allows the most practice ahead of tournament.</p>

      <img src="img/archon-1.jpg" class="imageadaptiveinfographic">

      <br>
      <p>Because of the lack of deck-building and the scarcity/opinionated-ness around what makes a strong deck or
        player...some players may actually gravitate towards other formats like reversal or adaptive or even sealed (in
        general) playing to the game's spirit of working with whatever tools are in front of you.</p>
      <hr>
      <!-- ADAPTIVE -->
      <h2 id="ADAPTIVEFORMAT">&#x1F9E0; ADAPTIVE</h2>

      <p>Best of 3 format iteration with chain bidding based on outcomes.</p>

      <p>Each player brings an archon or sealed deck and plays normally in a best of 3. </p>
      <img src="img/adaptive-1.jpg" class="imageadaptiveinfographic">

      <p>For the second game, each player swaps decks with his or her opponent and plays using his or her opponent’s
        deck.
      </p>

      <img src="img/adaptive-2.png" class="imageadaptiveinfographic">

      <p>If the third game occurs, players bid chains to use the deck which won both of the previous games.</p>
      <img src="img/adaptive-3.png" class="imageadaptiveinfographic">

      <hr>

      <!-- TRIAD -->
      <h2 id="TRIAD">TRIAD</h2>

      <p>Pick 3 decks to use throughout the tournament.</p>
      <p>Each round, each player chooses one of their opponent’s decks to “bench,” making that deck unusable for that
        match. Each round consists of a normal best-of-three match.
      <p>When a player wins a game, they must switch to their other deck for the rest of the match.</p>
      </p>

      <hr>

      <!-- ADAPTIVE SHORT -->
      <h2 id="ADAPTIVESHORT">ADAPTIVE-SHORT</h2>

      <p>The exact same concept as ADAPTIVE but compressed to 1 game for time and competition. A Fun exercise in both
        deck-list evaluation and chain bidding.</p>

      <hr>

      <!-- REVERSAL -->
      <h2 id="REVERSAL">&#128579; REVERSAL</h2>
      <p>Bring your worst deck and your opponent must play it against you.</p>
      <p> Here are some cards related to the REVERSAL format!</p>

      <p> Here are some example CONTROL cards:</p>

      <!-- COMBO -->
      <h2 id="COMBOS">COMBOS</h2>
      <p>Put the cards together and win! These decks focus on 2-3 card combos or clear synergies for a win condition.
      </p>

      <img src="img/blog-graphics/content_blog_graphic_033.png" class="imgbordered">

      <p>Example: Here is a neat combo that is currently legal in Magic the Gathering's standard format (at the
        time of writing this 2022).</p>

      <p>The idea is that you play out the Demon KICKED and then activate level 3 of the Warlock
        class on the same turn resulting in a Win.</p>

      <img src="img/mtg/491760.jpg" class="imgcardfull">
      <img src="img/mtg/527412.jpg" class="imgcardfull">

      <p>It requires 14 mana but to execute. It is an instant win if the player can somehow pull it off, these combos
        are
        frequently referred to as One Turn Kill (OTK) combos. </p>

      <hr>

      <p>Here is another (less costed) combo that is currently legal in Magic the Gathering's STANDARD format (2022).
      </p>

      <p>Since faceless haven can be all creature types..the combo here is to put the artifact's loyalty counter on the
        faceless haven and never turn it into a creature.</p>



      <img src="img/mtg/527291.jpg" class="imgcardfull">
      <img src="img/mtg/503874.jpg" class="imgcardfull">

      <p>This creates a soft-lock scenario where your opponent cannot win and you cannot lose if they do not have land
        destruction.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <p> Here are some example cards to look for in combo decks:</p>
      <img src="img/card_images/9a319f7f-62ac-46d2-9f1b-c8846e02589f.png" class="imgcardfull">

      <p> Above are not the actual combos but rather extremely powerful setup, recursion, or closer cards that support
        this play-style.</p>

      <hr>

      <!-- RUSH -->
      <h2 id="RUSH">RUSH</h2>
      <p>Sonic the hedgehog. Superman. A Speeding Bullet. Ferrari. These decks floor it and don't look back. This an
        interesting strategy for a number of reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make all other strategies irrelevant by simply being faster.</li>
        <li>Requires Less Cognitive lift at a tournament (compared to a more board or trick heavy deck.</li>
        <li>Wins Faster. More Time to recover between matches/games.</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="img/blog-graphics/content_blog_graphic_011.jpg" class="imgbordered">

      <p> Here are some example RUSH cards:</p>
      <img src="img/card_images/f96b20b3-df0e-4d43-a737-e7fa56ff690b.png" class="imgcardfull">

      <img src="img/card_images/341_222_QR5CWH4G69H3_en.png" class="imgcardfull">

      <p>RUSH or speed decks are a good style of play for a new player:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Easier to find/purchase.</li>
        <li>Can frequently brute force victories and forge keys via cheating so the opponent cannot respond with Amber
          Control</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- MID-RANGE -->
      <h2 id="MIDRANGE">MID-RANGE</h2>
      <p>A solid performer. It may not be top tier but is still competitive enough for archon solo or best of three.</p>

      <p>The majority of Keyforge decks are in this middling area.</p>

      <p>A skilled player could go 4/4 with this type of deck in a sealed or casual environment</p>

      <img src="img/blog-graphics/content_blog_graphic_005.jpg" class="imgbordered">

      <p>A good example midrange deck would be a Brobnar / Shadows / Untamed deck from set 1 aka Call of the Archons
        (CotA) with an equal focus on Fighting, Stealing, and Rushing.</p>

      <h2 id="GROUPHUG">GROUP HUG</h2>
      <p>The primary goal of a group hug deck is to make sure everyone gets to have fun and do cool things with their
        deck. Usually with a focus on symmetrical benefits that lead into a sneaky win condition.</p>

      <p>Just....strait up...STEAL. Thievery. Crime. Shadows.</p>


      <p>The footprint of this affect that plays to the win condition is still felt although the strength of shadows and
        stealing has diminished a bit since the Call of the Archons set.</p>

      <p>Decks that Live to purge either it's players' or opponents cards. Purging existed since Call of the Archons
        (set 1), it was not until World's Collide (Set 3) that the archetype came to a zenith with INFURNACE.
      </p>
      <p> Here are some example cards in decks with a primary focus on purging:</p>

      <p class="quote">Why would a player purge their own cards?</p>

      <p>In Keyforge, since there is no mill-ing out a strategy exists where this approach works towards making your
        deck more efficient (i.e. cycling back around to better cards or answers faster.) </p>

      <img src="img/card_images/452_070_PGQ7XMQ4M5J4_en.png" class="imgcardfull">

      <p>Thin-ing your deck with cards like Buzzle changes how a deck is re-evaluated e.g. if it has less useful or
        helpful cards.</p>

      <h2 id="CARDSTORYTELLING"> Card Story-Telling</h2>
      <p>Throughout the history of card game developmemnt (most notably with magic the gathering) there's been insider
        references and world-building subtext hidden in art, themes, and flavor text of cards. </p>

      <p>Here is an example from standard mtg right now (2021). Eaten alive shows how the champion of the parish met his
        end and transformed into the champion of the perished.

      <p>Keyforge equally rewarded the player for paying attention to motifs and hanging plot threads. Anomaly cards
        themselves represented a house from a future set (Time Traveler/Reverse Time Style!).

      <p>Here is an example of the shadows card MASTER PLAN visually telling you how to use it in the card art.
