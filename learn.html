    <p>KeyForge payed fan service in this way. It created BOTH a unique mythology (see <a href="#EASTEREGGS">Easter
        Eggs</a>) AND payed homage to games past like MTG.</p>

    <p>One of my favorite set 1 cards Speed Sigil is very similar to the MTG card Concordant Crossroads.</p>

      <h1 id="FORMATS">FORMATS</h1>

      <h2 id="ARCHONFORMAT"> &#128293; ARCHON</h2>

      <p>✅ OFFICIAL FORMAT</p>

      <p>There is no constructed (i.e. deck building) in KeyForge but this format comes closest to scratching that itch. Think friday night magic "standard". Does
        competitive play wet your whistle? Then this is the format for you. </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Each player brings a deck to use at the event</li>
        <li>You get to see your opponents deck list pre-game</li>
        <li>Best-Of-One (generally)</li>
        <li>35 min rounds</li>
        <li>Chainbound (generally)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>KeyForge decks can be complex to pilot. This has been the most enjoyable format for
        me allowing the most practice and agency in gameplay.</p>

      <img src="img/archon-1.jpg" class="imageadaptiveinfographic">

      <p>Because of the lack of deck-building and the scarcity/opinionated-ness around what makes a strong deck or
        player...some players may actually gravitate towards other formats like reversal or adaptive or even sealed
        playing to the game's spirit of working with whatever tools are in front of you.</p>

      <div class="topalign">
        <a href="#top">Back to Top</a>

      <!-- ADAPTIVE -->

      <p>✅ OFFICIAL FORMAT</p>

      <p>Best of 3 format iteration with chain bidding based on outcomes.</p>

      <p>Each player brings an archon or sealed deck and plays normally in a best of 3. </p>
      <img src="img/adaptive-1.jpg" class="imageadaptiveinfographic">

      <p>For the second game, each player swaps decks with his or her opponent and plays using his or her opponent’s
        deck.
      </p>

      <img src="img/adaptive-2.png" class="imageadaptiveinfographic">
      <p>If the third game occurs, players bid chains to use the deck which won both of the previous games.</p>

      <p>✅ OFFICIAL FORMAT</p>

      <p>Pick 3 decks to use throughout the tournament.</p>
      <p>Each round, each player chooses one of their opponent’s decks to “bench,” making that deck unusable for that
        match. Each round consists of a normal best-of-three match.
      <p>When a player wins a game, they must switch to their other deck for the rest of the match.</p>

      <!-- ADAPTIVE SHORT -->
      <h2 id="ADAPTIVESHORT">ADAPTIVE-SHORT</h2>

      <p>❌ UNOFFICIAL FORMAT</p>

      <p>The exact same concept as ADAPTIVE but compressed to 1 game for time and competition. A Fun exercise in both
        deck-list evaluation and chain bidding.</p>

      <p>Bring your worst deck and your opponent must play it against you.</p>
      <img src="img/blog-graphics/content_blog_graphic_040.png" class="imgcardfull">
      <p>This is an official format but is not supported in OP or in the GEM software.</p>
      <p>The vast majority of decks from the KeyForge Algorithm are midrange. Finding a "bad" KeyForge deck puts an
        alternate lens on an otherwise familiar race to the top.</p>

        <li>✅ Too many sweepers</li>

        <li>❌ Key Cheats. e.g. Do not bring a deck with Key of Darkness to a reversal tournament even if it is a
          objectively bad card for example.</li>

      <p>Since faceless haven can be all creature types..the combo here is to put the artifact's loyalty counter on the
        faceless haven and never turn it into a creature.</p>

      <p>Sonic the hedgehog. Superman. A Speeding Bullet. Ferrari. These decks floor it and don't look back. This an
        interesting strategy for a number of reasons:</p>
      <ul class="tableofcontentslist">
        <li>✅ Make all other strategies irrelevant by simply being faster</li>
        <li>✅ Keycheats like KeyCharge and Chota scoot around steal and capture threats from your opponent</li>
        <li>✅ Requires less cognitive lift at a tournament (compared to a more board or trick heavy deck.)</li>
        <li>✅ Wins faster! More time to recover between matches/games</li>

      <p>KeyForge is a dense, caloric, cheeseburger of a game.</p>

      <img src="img/blog-graphics/content_blog_graphic_053.jpg" class="imgbordered">

      <p>This is easy to forget after a player starts to scratch the beginning of what is possible.</p>

      <p>Teaching decks are example decks you could give a new player to pilot or battle against during a teaching game.
        The best example of this (sorta) is the initial 2 decks that came in the set 1 starter.</p>

      <p>Ideally:</p>
      <ul class="tableofcontentslist">
        <li>❌ No archiving</li>
        <li>❌ No Chains (unless they are on a more experienced player)</li>

        <li>❌ No cards that say "at current cost"</li>
        <li>✅ A Focus on fun over knowledge ramp.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The first game of keyforge with a new player is not the time to suss out the difference between capture and
        steal. Or for that matter start accumulating some mental math with Tolas
        triggers.</p>

      <p class="quote">Why would a player purge their own cards?</p>

      <p>There is no mill-ing out in Keyforge. A strategy exists where targeting yourself makes your
        deck more efficient (i.e. cycling back around to better cards or answers faster).</p>

      <img src="img/card_images/452_070_PGQ7XMQ4M5J4_en.png" class="imgcardgalleryfull">

      <p>Thin-ing your deck with cards like Buzzle changes how a deck is re-evaluated e.g. if it has less useful or
